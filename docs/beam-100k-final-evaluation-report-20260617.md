# BEAM 100K Final Evaluation Report

Date: 2026-06-17

This report records the final two full BEAM 100K validations kept after cleanup, compares them with True Memory Pro, and summarizes the current operator state for later project review.

## Result Summary

Target baseline: True Memory Pro on BEAM 100K = `0.766`.

Both retained full-run validations exceed the target. The observed current-code band is `0.7676505254168324` to `0.7751916960517531`. The second run is closer to the target, so future work should preserve this baseline before making broad retrieval or answer-layer changes.

| System / Run | BEAM 100K Accuracy | Delta vs True Memory Pro 0.766 | Answer Match Rate | Answer Failures | Judge Failures | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| True Memory Pro baseline | `0.7660000000` | `0.0000000000` | N/A | N/A | N/A | Reference |

## Category Scores

| Category | Run 1 Accuracy | Run 2 Accuracy | Direction / Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| abstention | `1.0000` | `0.9875` | Strong; no current priority. |
| contradiction_resolution | `0.76875` | `0.75625` | Near target but still below `0.8`; remaining work is claim-slot grounding, not answer wording. |
| event_ordering | `0.2076758891` | `0.2067433494` | Main unresolved hard category. |
| information_extraction | `0.7828125` | `0.8041666667` | Borderline to strong; exact answer operators are promising but should stay narrowly gated. |
| instruction_following | `0.9125` | `0.8875` | Strong; typed requirements helped. |
| knowledge_update | `0.8125` | `0.8000` | Above `0.8` band; value/state operators are useful. |
| multi_session_reasoning | `0.7869345238` | `0.7719345238` | Slightly below `0.8`; role/scope count/list operators remain next-step candidates. |
| preference_following | `0.9375` | `0.95625` | Strong; keep current constraint/checklist direction. |
| summarization | `0.7182440476` | `0.7061607143` | Still low; coverage matrix helped but broad summaries miss rubric facets. |
| temporal_reasoning | `0.8250` | `0.8000` | Restored from instability; deterministic temporal consumer is validated but still variance-sensitive. |

## Runtime Cleanup

Historical benchmark artifacts were removed from `.runtime/beam-runs` after recording this report. The runtime directory now keeps only the two final full-run outputs, diagnostics, and partial worker logs listed above.

Old probes, targeted runs, category runs, stale full-runs, and experimental partials were intentionally deleted to reduce noise and prevent future reviews from treating obsolete runs as current evidence.

## Current Operator State

The current high-level direction is acceptable: the final gains came from moving repeated diagnostics into typed pack/model-view structures rather than adding direct qid/gold-answer branches. There is still architecture debt in the answer adapter, and future work should avoid expanding answer templates or named scenario regexes.

### Validated / Useful Operators

| Operator Family | Main Files / Entry Points | Current State |
|---|---|---|
| Temporal endpoint pairs and deterministic temporal consumer | `fusion_memory/retrieval/temporal_pack.py`, `fusion_memory/eval/model_adapters.py` | Validated. The final temporal gate added score-margin tolerance, generic direct duration pair handling, and event-slot ambiguity protection. Full-run temporal was `0.825` then `0.800`. |
| Summary coverage matrix / must-mention points | `fusion_memory/eval/model_adapters.py` | Useful but incomplete. Query-focused summary points improved final full-run summarization into the `0.706-0.718` band, but broad summaries still miss rubric-specific facets. |
| Value history and slot-state transition | `fusion_memory/retrieval/value_history_pack.py`, `fusion_memory/retrieval/slot_state_transition.py` | Useful. Knowledge update reached `0.8125` then `0.800`. Remaining failures need stronger same-topic value separation and state transition modeling, not local regex additions. |
| Aggregation answer candidates for multi-session | `fusion_memory/retrieval/aggregation_answers.py`, `fusion_memory/retrieval/aggregation_pack.py` | Directionally correct. Distinct counts, value deltas, deadline candidates, and grouped count prototypes helped, but role/scope over-counting remains. |
| Preference constraints and answer requirements | `fusion_memory/retrieval/aggregation_preferences.py`, `fusion_memory/retrieval/answer_requirements.py` | Strong. Preference stayed `0.9375-0.95625`; instruction stayed `0.8875-0.9125`. Preserve typed constraints/checklists and avoid scenario-specific prompt examples. |
| Contradiction claim pairs | `fusion_memory/retrieval/contradiction_claims.py`, `fusion_memory/eval/model_adapters.py` | Partially useful. Category is around `0.756-0.769`; remaining work is query-slot-grounded positive/negative/current claim selection. |
| Exact answer operators | `fusion_memory/retrieval/exact_answer_operators.py` | Promising but not fully validated as a broad category gain. Keep high-confidence gating; avoid frontloading exact candidates into source spans without category replay. |

### Heuristic / Architecture Risk

- `fusion_memory/eval/model_adapters.py` is doing too much: model-pack projection, prompt construction, deterministic answer shortcuts, temporal/summarization/contradiction logic, and benchmark-specific instructions. Further growth here risks turning typed operators back into answer-layer heuristics.
- Named scenario recognizers should not be expanded. Historical diagnostics showed warning signs around book-store/live-chat/patent/Excel-like cases.
- The acceptable path is to promote useful behavior into reusable typed contracts: role/scope, slot state, endpoint pairs, conflict claims, and summary facets.
- The current code has no known qid/gold-answer branch, but it is close enough to the heuristic threshold that future additions should require full-category validation.

## Event Ordering Status

`event_ordering` remains the main structural weakness:

- Final full-run scores: `0.2076758891` and `0.2067433494`.
- Historical category attempts around scoped episodes / raw-facet preservation stayed near `0.196-0.200` and did not produce a real category gain.
- Failures are mostly not simple evidence absence. Historical diagnostics identified `event_order_or_label_mismatch`: the pack often has relevant spans, but the selected sequence abstraction and labels do not align with the BEAM reference ordering.

Current event-ordering files to review:

- `fusion_memory/retrieval/event_ordering_pack.py`
- `fusion_memory/retrieval/event_ordering_sequence.py`
- `fusion_memory/retrieval/event_ordering_typed.py`
- `fusion_memory/retrieval/event_ordering_common.py`
- `fusion_memory/retrieval/event_ordering_episodes.py`
- `fusion_memory/retrieval/event_ordering_records.py`
- `fusion_memory/retrieval/event_ordering_labels.py`
- `fusion_memory/retrieval/event_graph_selection.py`
- `fusion_memory/eval/model_adapters.py`

Recommended future direction:

1. Do not keep adding event-ordering label phrase lists or answer templates.
2. Build a graph-first chronology layer with first-class aspect/topic nodes.
3. Model typed edges such as `NEXT`, `SAME_TOPIC`, `REFINES`, `SUPERSEDES`, `STARTS`, and `COMPLETES`.
4. Keep heuristics only as fallback scoring and labeling, not as the primary event-ordering mechanism.
5. Validate event-ordering by full category runs, because targeted probes repeatedly failed to predict full-category movement.

## Review Entry Points

Recommended first files for project review:

| Area | Entry Point |
|---|---|
| Final benchmark evidence | `.runtime/beam-runs/current_validation_20260616/full_after_temporal_gate_w24_20260617.json` and repeat file |
| Current handoff state | `AGENTS.md` |
| Answer/model-pack projection and deterministic consumers | `fusion_memory/eval/model_adapters.py` |
| Pack construction | `fusion_memory/retrieval/evidence_pack.py` |
| Temporal operators | `fusion_memory/retrieval/temporal_pack.py` |
| Multi-session aggregation | `fusion_memory/retrieval/aggregation_answers.py`, `fusion_memory/retrieval/aggregation_pack.py` |
| Knowledge-update state | `fusion_memory/retrieval/value_history_pack.py`, `fusion_memory/retrieval/slot_state_transition.py` |
| Preferences/instructions | `fusion_memory/retrieval/aggregation_preferences.py`, `fusion_memory/retrieval/answer_requirements.py` |
| Event ordering | `fusion_memory/retrieval/event_ordering_pack.py` and related event-ordering modules |

## Recommendation

Stop optimization for now and preserve the current baseline. The system passed BEAM 100K twice against the `0.766` target, but the second pass margin is narrow. If work resumes, start with an architecture review and event-ordering design, or with full-category typed-operator loops for summarization and multi-session. Do not continue by adding single-case answer templates.
